<h2>Breadth and Depth Metrics</h2>
<p>Bu et al. (2021) proposed a multidimensional way to quantify citation impact for research publications. Such methods include breadth and depth. Breadth and depth measure if papers that cite a focal publication also cite each other. If papers that cite the focal publication also cite each other, then it has a deeper impact on its cluster. If the papers citing the focal publication do not cite other papers citing the focal publication, then it has a broad impact on its cluster.</p>
